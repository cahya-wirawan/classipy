10102273	Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.	Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/ threonine kinase Akt, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery, including BAD and Caspase 9. In this study, we demonstrate that Akt also regulates the activity of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors. In the presence of survival factors, Akt phosphorylates FKHRL1, leading to FKHRL1's association with 14-3-3 proteins and FKHRL1's retention in the cytoplasm. Survival factor withdrawal leads to FKHRL1 dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and target gene activation. Within the nucleus, FKHRL1 triggers apoptosis most likely by inducing the expression of genes that are critical for cell death, such as the Fas ligand gene.	NULL	TRUE
10233885	C/EBPepsilon directly interacts with the DNA binding domain of c-myb and cooperatively activates transcription of myeloid promoters.	C/EBPepsilon is essential for granulocytic differentiation. We investigated the role of C/EBPepsilon in the transcriptional activation of various myeloid-specific genes. We found that two C/EBPepsilon isoforms, p32 and p30, possessing transcriptional activation domains were coexpressed in myeloid cells. Interestingly, isoform C/EBPepsilon p30 but not p32 was differentially upregulated in NB-4 promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with retinoids. Both isoforms bound specifically to C/EBP sites in myeloid promoters. The kd for C/EBPepsilon binding to the C/EBP site of the neutrophil elastase promoter was 4.2 nmol/L. In transfection assays using the nonhematopoietic cell line, CV-1, the p32 isoform activated promoters from the myeloid-specific mim-1, neutrophil elastase, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor genes by 2.5-, 1.8-, and 1.6-fold, respectively. The p30 isoform lacked significant transcriptional activity, suggesting that other hematopoietic-specific factors were required for its function. Consistent with this prediction, transfections into the hematopoietic cell line Jurkat showed a 9.0- and 2.5-fold activation of the mim-1 promoter by the p32 and p30 isoforms, respectively. The additional 32 NH2-terminal residues made p32 a significantly more potent transcriptional activator than p30. T lymphoblasts (Jurkat cells) and immature myeloid cells (eg, Kcl22 cells) expressed high levels of the c-myb hematopoietic transcription factor. Cotransfection of c-myb with either the p32 or p30 isoform of C/EBPepsilon in CV-1 cells cooperatively transactivated the mim-1 promoter by 20- and 16-fold, respectively, and the neutrophil elastase promoter by 10-and 7-fold, respectively. Pulldown assays showed that each C/EBPepsilon isoform interacted directly with the DNA binding domain of the c-myb protein. Further studies showed that Kcl22 myeloid cells only contained active C/EBPepsilon, but not C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, or C/EBPdelta. A mutation of the C/EBP site in the neutrophil elastase promoter markedly decreased the transactivation of the promoter in Kcl22 myeloblasts. These results demonstrate a role for C/EBPepsilon in regulating myeloid promoters, such as neutrophil elastase, probably through a direct interaction with c-myb.	NULL	FALSE
10329662	Cloning and characterization of a novel zinc finger transcriptional repressor. A direct role of the zinc finger motif in repression.	We have identified a novel transcriptional repressor, AEBP2, that binds to a regulatory sequence (termed AE-1) located in the proximal promoter region of the aP2 gene that encodes the adipose fatty acid-binding protein. Sequence analysis of AEBP2 cDNA revealed that it encodes a protein containing three Gli-Kr√ºppel (Cys2-His2)-type zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis revealed two transcripts (4.5 and 3.5 kilobases) which were ubiquitously expressed in every mouse tissue examined. In co-transfection assays, AEBP2 repressed transcription from the homologous aP2 promoter containing multiple copies of the AE-1 sequence. Moreover, a chimeric construct encoding a fusion AEBP2 protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was able to repress the transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter containing the Gal4-binding sequence. The transcriptional repression function of AEBP2 was completely abolished when one of the conserved histidine residues and a flanking serine residue in the middle zinc finger were replaced with an arginine residue. The defective transcriptional repression function of the mutant derivative was due neither to lack of expression nor to a failure to localize to the nucleus. Moreover, both the wild-type and mutant derivative of either the histidine-tagged recombinant AEBP2 proteins or the in vitro translated Gal4-AEBP2 fusion proteins were equally able to bind to the target DNA. These results suggest that a portion of the zinc finger structure may play a direct role in transcriptional repression function, but not in DNA binding.	TRUE	TRUE
10446138	The adenovirus oncoprotein E1a stimulates binding of transcription factor ETF to transcriptionally activate the p53 gene.	Expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage. During adenovirus infection, levels of p53 protein also increase. It has been shown that this increase is due not only to increased stability of the p53 protein but to the transcriptional activation of the p53 gene during infection. We demonstrate here that the E1a proteins of adenovirus are responsible for activating the mouse p53 gene and that both major E1a proteins, 243R and 289R, are required for complete activation. E1a brings about the binding of two cellular transcription factors to the mouse p53 promoter. One of these, ETF, binds to three upstream sites in the p53 promoter and one downstream site, whereas E2F binds to one upstream site in the presence of E1a. Our studies indicate that E2F binding is not essential for activation of the p53 promoter but that ETF is. Our data indicate the ETF site located downstream of the start site of transcription is the key site in conferring E1a responsiveness on the p53 promoter.	TRUE	TRUE
10581008	Polyamine depletion up-regulates c-Myc expression, yet induces G(1) arrest and terminal differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells.	The ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene is a transcriptional target of c-Myc. Exponentially growing cells usually exhibit high c-Myc levels and high ODC levels, whereas stationary phase cells and terminally differentiated cells have low levels of both proteins. Therefore, we were surprised to find that when F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells were blocked in the G(1) phase of their cell cycle and induced to differentiate by irreversible inhibition of the ODC activity, the expression of c-Myc was up-regulated instead of being down-regulated. During the course of differentiation, the c-myc gene was constitutively expressed, and c-Myc protein accumulated. In transfection experiments, using ODC promoter-reporter gene fusion constructs, the accumulation of c-Myc protein, resulting from polyamine depletion, led to increased reporter gene expression. This finding is consistent with the view that depletion of polyamines relieves the suppression that they exert on c-myc mRNA translation, causing an accumulation of c-Myc protein, which in turn transactivates its target gene, the bona fide ODC gene. Thus, the accumulation of an active c-Myc protein does not preclude differentiative events, nor does it override the growth arrest caused by polyamine depletion. These results suggest a new role for polyamines-as negative regulators of c-Myc expression.	NULL	TRUE
10646861	PLAG1, the main translocation target in pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands, is a positive regulator of IGF-II.	PLAG1, a novel developmentally regulated C2H2 zinc finger gene, is consistently rearranged and overexpressed in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands with 8q12 translocations. In this report, we show that PLAG1 is a nuclear protein that binds DNA in a specific manner. The consensus PLAG1 binding site is a bipartite element containing a core sequence, GRGGC, and a G-cluster, RGGK, separated by seven random nucleotides. DNA binding is mediated mainly via three of the seven zinc fingers, with fingers 6 and 7 interacting with the core and finger 3 with the G-cluster. In transient transactivation assays, PLAG1 specifically activates transcription from its consensus DNA binding site, indicating that PLAG1 is a genuine transcription factor. Potential PLAG1 binding sites were found in the promoter 3 of the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene. We show that PLAG1 binds IGF-II promoter 3 and stimulates its activity. Moreover, IGF-II transcripts derived from the P3 promoter are highly expressed in salivary gland adenomas overexpressing PLAG1. In contrast, they are not detectable in adenomas without abnormal PLAG1 expression nor in normal salivary gland tissue. This indicates a perfect correlation between PLAG1 and IGF-II expression. All of these results strongly suggest that IGF-II is one of the PLAG1 target genes, providing us with the first clue for understanding the role of PLAG1 in salivary gland tumor development.	TRUE	TRUE
10660629	Regulation of BRCA1 expression by the Rb-E2F pathway.	Inheritance of a mutant allele of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 confers increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Likewise, inheritance of a mutant allele of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) results in the development of retinoblastoma and/or osteosarcoma, and both alleles are often mutated or inactivated in sporadic forms of these and other cancers. We now demonstrate that the product of the RB1 gene, Rb, regulates the expression of the murine Brca1 and human BRCA1 genes through its ability to modulate E2F transcriptional activity. The Brca1 gene is identified as an in vivo target of E2F1 in a transgenic mouse model. The Brca1 promoter contains E2F DNA-binding sites that mediate transcriptional activation by E2F1 and repression by Rb. Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16(INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The human BRCA1 promoter also contains a conserved E2F site and is similarly regulated by E2F1 and Rb. This functional link between the BRCA1 and Rb tumor suppressors may provide insight into the mechanism by which BRCA1 inactivation contributes to cancer development.	TRUE	TRUE
10692448	The human 20-kDa 5'-(CGG)(n)-3'-binding protein is targeted to the nucleus and affects the activity of the FMR1 promoter.	Previous reports have described the human DNA CGG repeat-binding protein (CGGBP1 or p20), which binds specifically to nonmethylated, but not to methylated, 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeats in the promoter of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The results of transfection experiments into human HeLa cells using a p20-green fluorescent protein fusion construct indicate that the p20 protein is targeted to the nucleus. By deletion analyses, a nuclear localization signal has been found between amino acids 80 and 84. Deletions between amino acids 69 and 71 and between 95 and 167 interfere with 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' binding. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays using DNA with 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeats of different lengths render it likely that oligomers of the p20 protein bind to the repeat. In cotransfection experiments, the activity of the FMR1 promoter is reduced by the presence of p20. Upon transfection of the p20 cDNA construct into HeLa cells, transcription of the endogenous FMR1 gene is decreased. The green fluorescent protein-p20 fusion protein associates preferentially with the telomeres of the short arms of human chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. Their telomeres carry the genes for the 28 S rRNA, which contain 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeats. The translated region of the p20 gene from three healthy, five fragile X syndrome, and five premutation-carrying individuals has been sequenced, but mutations have not been detected.	TRUE	TRUE
10723141	Identification of Mad as a repressor of the human telomerase (hTERT) gene.	Activation of telomerase, which has been frequently associated with cellular immortality, may constitute a key step in the development of human cancer. De-repression in the expression of its catalytic subunit hTERT gene has been proposed to directly link to the telomerase activation in tumor cells. Little is known about the mechanism how the hTERT gene is repressed in telomerase-negative mortal cells. This study was conducted, using an expression cloning approach, with the aim of identifying the gene(s) responsible for repressing the hTERT gene expression. Using this genetic screen, we isolated the transcription factor Mad as a repressor. Mutation of its DNA binding sites caused significant de-repression of hTERT promoter activity in mortal cells. This Mad-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter in mortal cells was counteracted by ectopic expression of Myc. The antagonism between Mad and Myc was also observed with an endogenous hTERT promoter. Their potential roles in differential hTERT promoter activities were further supported by the relative amounts of Mad and Myc proteins detected in immortal and mortal cells. Thus, Mad may be a direct negative regulator of hTERT in mortal cells and this repression mechanism can be inhibited by induction of Myc in immortal cells.	TRUE	TRUE
10764806	Three-amino acid extension loop homeodomain proteins Meis2 and TGIF differentially regulate transcription.	Three-amino acid extension loop (TALE) homeobox proteins are highly conserved transcription regulators. We report that two members of this family, Meis2 and TGIF, which frequently have overlapping consensus binding sites on complementary DNA strands in opposite orientations, can function competitively. For example, in the D(1A) gene, which encodes the predominant dopamine receptor in the striatum, Meis2 and TGIF bind to the activator sequence ACT (-1174 to -1154) and regulate transcription differentially in a cell type-specific manner. Among the five cloned splice variants of Meis2, isoforms Meis2a-d activate the D(1A) promoter in most cell types tested, whereas TGIF competes with Meis2 binding to DNA and represses Meis2-induced transcription activation. Consequently, Meis2 cannot activate the D(1A) promoter in a cell that has abundant TGIF expression. The Meis2 message is highly co-localized with the D(1A) message in adult striatal neurons, whereas TGIF is barely detectable in the adult brain. Our observations provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that Meis2 and TGIF differentially regulate their target genes. Thus, the delicate ratio between Meis2 and TGIF expression in a given cell type determines the cell-specific expression of the D(1A) gene. We also found that splice variant Meis2e, which has a truncated homeodomain, cannot bind to the D(1A) ACT sequence or activate transcription. However, Meis2e is an effective dominant negative regulator by blocking Meis2d-induced transcription activation. Thus, truncated homeoproteins with no DNA binding domains can have important regulatory functions.	NULL	TRUE
10770937	Direct transactivation of the anti-apoptotic gene apolipoprotein J (clusterin) by B-MYB.	B-MYB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor involved in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. In an attempt to isolate B-MYB-regulated genes that may explain the role of B-MYB in cellular processes, representational difference analysis was performed in neuroblastoma cell lines with different levels of B-MYB expression. One of the genes, the mRNA levels of which were enhanced in B-MYB expressing cells, was ApoJ/Clusterin(SGP-2/TRMP-2) (ApoJ/Clusterin), previously implicated in regulation of apoptosis and tumor progression. Here we show that the human ApoJ/Clusterin gene contains a Myb binding site in its 5' flanking region, which interacts with bacterially synthesized B-MYB protein and mediates B-MYB-dependent transactivation of the ApoJ/Clusterin promoter in transient transfection assays. Endogenous ApoJ/Clusterin expression is induced in mammalian cell lines following transient transfection of a B-MYB cDNA. Blockage of secreted clusterin by a monoclonal antibody results in increased apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells exposed to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Thus, activation of ApoJ/Clusterin by B-MYB may be an important step in the regulation of apoptosis in normal and diseased cells.	TRUE	FALSE
10856241	JunB suppresses cell proliferation by transcriptional activation of p16(INK4a) expression.	A role for the transcription factor JunB in proliferation control was investigated in genetically modified mouse fibroblasts. Increased JunB expression induced high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a), leading to premature senescence in primary cells and reduced proliferation in 3T3 cells, whereas lack of JunB expression results in decreased p16 levels. Furthermore, JunB-mediated p16 induction in 3T3 cells completely abolished cyclin D-associated kinase activity, resulting in reduced pRb hyperphosphorylation and G(1)-phase extension. Moreover, three AP1-like binding sites were identified in the p16 promoter through which JunB directly activates p16 transcription. Elevated JunB expression in 3T3 cells also inhibited Ras- and Src-mediated transformation and tumour growth in vivo. The suppressive effect of JunB on cell proliferation was shown to be dependent on p16 since it did not occur in INK4a(-/-) fibroblasts that lack both p16 and p19(ARF). These results demonstrate that p16 is a direct transcriptional target gene of JunB and identify JunB as a negative regulator of cell proliferation.	TRUE	TRUE
11114890	Reciprocal activation of xenobiotic response genes by nuclear receptors SXR/PXR and CAR.	The cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene products such as CYP3A and CYP2B are essential for the metabolism of steroid hormones and xenochemicals including prescription drugs. Nuclear receptor SXR/PXR (steroid and xenobiotic receptor/pregnenolone X receptor) has been shown both biochemically and genetically to activate CYP3A genes, while similar studies have established constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) as a CYP2B regulator. The response elements in these genes are also distinct, furthering the concept of independent regulation. Unexpectedly, we found that SXR can regulate CYP2B, both in cultured cells and in transgenic mice via adaptive recognition of the phenobarbital response element (PBRE). In a type of functional symmetry, orphan receptor CAR was also found to activate CYP3A through previously defined SXR/PXR response elements. These observations not only provide a rational explanation for the activation of multiple CYP gene classes by certain xenobiotics, but also reveal the existence of a metabolic safety net that confers a second layer of protection to the harmful effects of toxic compounds and at the same time increases the propensity for drug-drug interactions.

11238674	Molecular basis of deficient IL-2 production in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease characterized by diverse cellular and biochemical aberrations, including decreased production of IL-2. Here we show that nuclear extracts from unstimulated SLE T cells, unlike extracts from normal T cells, express increased amounts of phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element modulator (p-CREM) that binds the -180 site of the IL-2 promoter. Nuclear extracts from stimulated normal T cells display increased binding of phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein (p-CREB) to the -180 site of the IL-2 promoter, whereas nuclear extracts from stimulated SLE T cells display primarily p-CREM and decreased p-CREB binding. In SLE T cells, p-CREM bound to the transcriptional coactivators, CREB binding protein and p300. Increased expression of p-CREM correlated with decreased production of IL-2. The transcription of a reporter gene driven by the -180 site was enhanced in normal T cells, but was suppressed in SLE T cells. These experiments demonstrate that transcriptional repression is responsible for the decreased production of IL-2 by SLE T cells.	NULL	TRUE
11268217	Regulation of CD40 and CD40 ligand by the AT-hook transcription factor AKNA.	Proteins containing AT hooks bind A/T-rich DNA through a nine-amino-acid motif and are thought to co-regulate transcription by modifying the architecture of DNA, thereby enhancing the accessibility of promoters to transcription factors. Here we describe AKNA, a human AT-hook protein that directly binds the A/T-rich regulatory elements of the promoters of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) and coordinately regulates their expression. Consistent with its function, AKNA is a nuclear protein that contains multiple PEST protein-cleavage motifs, which are common in regulatory proteins with high turnover rates. AKNA is mainly expressed by B and T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. During B-lymphocyte differentiation, AKNA is mainly expressed by germinal centre B lymphocytes, a stage in which receptor and ligand interactions are crucial for B-lymphocyte maturation. Our findings show that an AT-hook molecule can coordinately regulate the expression of a key receptor and its ligand, and point towards a molecular mechanism that explains homotypic cell interactions.

11274170	PEA3 is up-regulated in response to Wnt1 and activates the expression of cyclooxygenase-2.	The inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is aberrantly expressed in intestinal tumors resulting from APC mutation, and is also transcriptionally up-regulated in mouse mammary epithelial cells in response to Wnt1 expression. beta-Catenin stabilization is a consequence of both APC mutation and Wnt signaling. We have previously observed coordinate regulation of the matrilysin promoter by beta-catenin and Ets family transcription factors of the PEA3 subfamily. Here we show that while beta-catenin only weakly activates the COX-2 promoter, PEA3 family transcription factors are potent activators of COX-2 transcription. Consistent with this, PEA3 is up-regulated in Wnt1-expressing mouse mammary epithelial cells, and PEA3 factors are highly expressed in tumors from Wnt1 transgenic mice, in which Cox-2 is also up-regulated. Promoter mapping experiments suggest that the NF-IL6 site in the COX-2 promoter is important for mediating PEA3 responsiveness. The NF-IL6 site is also important for COX-2 transcription in some colorectal cancer lines (Shao, J., Sheng, H., Inoue, H., Morrow, J. D., and DuBois, R. N. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 33951-33956), and PEA3 factors are highly expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines. Therefore, we speculate that PEA3 factors may contribute to the up-regulation of COX-2 expression resulting from both APC mutation and Wnt1 expression.	TRUE	TRUE
11278455	Genomic structure of the promoters of the human estrogen receptor-alpha gene demonstrate changes in chromatin structure induced by AP2gamma.	Expression of human estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) involves the activity from several promoters that give rise to alternate untranslated 5' exons. However, the genomic locations of the alternate 5' exons have not been reported previously. We have developed a contig map of the human ERalpha gene that includes all of the known alternate 5' exons. By using S1 nuclease and 5'- rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the cap sites for the alternate ERalpha transcripts E and H were identified. DNase I-hypersensitive sites specific to ERalpha-positive cells were associated with each of the cap sites. A DNase I-hypersensitive site, HS1, was localized to binding sites for AP2 in the untranslated region of exon 1 and was invariably present in the chromatin structure of ERalpha-positive cells. Overexpression of AP2gamma in human mammary epithelial cells generated the HS1-hypersensitive site. The ERalpha promoter was induced by AP2gamma in mammary epithelial cells, and trans-activation was dependent upon the region of the promoter containing the HS1 site. These results demonstrate that AP2gamma trans-activates the ERalpha gene in hormone-responsive tumors by inducing changes in the chromatin structure of the ERalpha promoter. These data are further evidence for a critical role for AP2 in the oncogenesis of hormone-responsive breast cancers.	TRUE	FALSE
11299318	Pitx3 activates mouse tyrosine hydroxylase promoter via a high-affinity binding site.	Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine and (nor)adrenaline biosynthesis. Regulation of its gene expression is complex and different regulatory mechanisms appear to be operative in various neuronal lineages. Pitx3, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, has been cloned from neuronal tissues and, in the CNS, mouse Pitx3 is exclusively expressed in midbrain dopaminergic (MesDA) neurons from embryonic day 11 (E11). TH appears in these neurons at E11.5, consistent with a putative role of Pitx3 in TH transcription. We show that Pitx3 activates the TH promoter through direct interaction with a single high-affinity binding site within the promoter and that this site is sufficient for Pitx3 responsiveness. In contrast, we did not observe an effect of Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor essential for normal development of MesDA neurons, on TH promoter activity. Pitx3 activation of TH promoter activity appears to be cell-dependent suggesting that Pitx3 action may be modulated by other(s) regulatory mechanism(s) and factor(s).	TRUE	TRUE
11337499	JunD regulates transcription of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and interleukin-6 genes in activated hepatic stellate cells.	Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to a myofibroblast-like phenotype is the pivotal event in hepatic wound healing and fibrosis. Rat HSCs activated in vitro express JunD, Fra2, and FosB as the predominant AP-1 DNA-binding proteins, and all three associate with an AP-1 sequence that is essential for activity of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) promoter. In this study, we used expression vectors for wild-type, dominant-negative, and forced homodimeric (Jun/eb1 chimeric factors) forms of JunD and other Fos and Jun proteins to determine the requirement for JunD in the transcriptional regulation of the TIMP-1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes. JunD activity was required for TIMP-1 gene promoter activity, whereas overexpression of Fra2 or FosB caused a repression of promoter activity. The ability of homodimeric JunD/eb1 to elevate TIMP-1 promoter activity supports a role for JunD homodimers as the major AP-1-dependent transactivators of the TIMP-1 gene. IL-6 promoter activity was induced upon activation of HSCs and also required JunD activity; however, expression of JunD/eb1 homodimers resulted in transcriptional repression. Mutagenesis of the IL-6 promoter showed that an AP-1 DNA-binding site previously reported to be an activator of transcription in fibroblasts functions as a suppressor of promoter activity in HSCs. We conclude that JunD activates IL-6 gene transcription as a heterodimer and operates at an alternative DNA-binding site in the promoter. The relevance of these findings to events occurring in the injured liver was addressed by showing that AP-1 DNA-binding complexes are induced during HSC activation and contain JunD as the predominant Jun family protein. JunD is therefore an important transcriptional regulator of genes responsive to Jun homo- and heterodimers in activated HSCs.	TRUE	TRUE
11358962	Characterization of a new subfamily of winged-helix/forkhead (Fox) genes that are expressed in the lung and act as transcriptional repressors.	Epithelial gene expression in the lung is thought to be regulated by the coordinate activity of several different families of transcription factors including the Fox family of winged-helix/forkhead DNA-binding proteins. In this report, we have identified and characterized two members of this Fox gene family, Foxp1 and Foxp2, and show that they comprise a new subfamily of Fox genes expressed in the lung. Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at high levels in the lung as early as E12.5 of mouse development with Foxp2 expression restricted to the airway epithelium. In addition, Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at lower levels in neural, intestinal, and cardiovascular tissues during development. Upon differentiation of the airway epithelium along the proximal-distal axis, Foxp2 expression becomes restricted to the distal alveolar epithelium whereas Foxp1 expression is observed in the distal epithelium and mesenchyme. Foxp1 and Foxp2 can regulate epithelial lung gene transcription as was demonstrated by their ability to dramatically repress the mouse CC10 promoter and, to a lesser extent, the human surfactant protein C promoter. In addition, GAL4 fusion proteins encoding subdomains of Foxp1 and Foxp2 demonstrate that an independent and homologous transcriptional repression domain lies within the N-terminal end of the proteins. Together, these studies suggest that Foxp1 and Foxp2 are important regulators of lung epithelial gene transcription.	TRUE	TRUE
11427482	The role of c-Myb and Sp1 in the up-regulation of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A gene expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.	Liver-specific and non-liver-specific methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) are products of two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A, respectively, that catalyze the formation of S-adenosylmethionine. We showed a switch from MAT1A to MAT2A expression at the transcriptional level in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that facilitates cancer cell growth. The purpose of the present study was to better understand the molecular mechanism of increased MAT2A expression in HCC. In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis revealed two protected sites (-354 to -312 and -73 to -28) using nuclear proteins from HCC and HepG2 cells, but not normal liver. These sites are also protected in HepG2 cells on in vivo DNase I footprinting analysis. These protected sites contain consensus binding sites for c-Myb and Sp1. In HCC, the mRNA levels of c-myb and Sp1 and binding to their respective sites increased. Mutation of the c-Myb or Sp1 site reduced MAT2A promoter activity by 67% and 50%, respectively. The importance of these cis-acting elements and trans-activating factors was confirmed using heterologous promoter and expression vectors. Increased expression of c-Myb and Sp1 and binding to the MAT2A promoter contribute to transcriptional up-regulation of MAT2A in HCC.-Yang, H., Huang, Z.-Z., Wang, J., Lu, S. C.

11438543	Functional importance of Stat3 tetramerization in activation of the alpha 2-macroglobulin gene.	A tetrameric Stat3 complex was found to be essential in transfection experiments for maximal interleukin-6-inducible activation of alpha2-macroglobulin gene promoter. Stable tetramer formation of purified phosphorylated Stat3 was dependent on protein.protein interaction involving the N-terminal domain of Stat3. The functional importance of tetramer formation was shown by the decreased levels of transcriptional activation associated with hypomorphic mutations in N-terminal residues.	NULL	FALSE
11478782	The transcription factor onecut-2 controls the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor gene.	Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is essential for melanocyte differentiation. MITF mutations are associated with some cases of Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type 2. WS is a dominantly inherited disease characterized by auditory-pigmentary defects that result from the absence of melanocytes. The lack of mutation in MITF coding sequences in some WS2 patients suggests that unidentified factors controlling MITF expression might be involved. We show here that the cut-homeodomain transcription factor Onecut-2 (OC-2) is expressed in melanocytes and binds to the MITF gene promoter. Overexpression of OC-2 in transfected cells stimulates MITF promoter activity. Mutations that prevent OC-2 binding decrease MITF promoter activity by 75%. Based on these results, we searched in 56 WS2 patients for mutations in the OC2 gene or in OC-2 binding sites in the MITF promoter, but none was found. These results show that OC-2 stimulates MITF expression and that OC2 is a candidate gene, but not a common cause, of WS.	NULL	TRUE
11533040	Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase gene induction by bile acid activated farnesoid X receptor.	Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (STD) is a hydroxysteroid sulfo-conjugating enzyme with preferential substrate specificity for C-19 androgenic steroids and C-24 bile acids. STD is primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and adrenal cortex. Earlier studies have shown that androgens inhibit the rat Std promoter function through a negative androgen response region located between -235 and -310 base pair positions (Song, C. S., Jung, M. H., Kim, S. C., Hassan, T., Roy, A. K., and Chatterjee, B. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 21856-21866). Here we report that the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) also acts as an important regulator of the Std gene promoter. CDCA is a potent inducer of the Std gene, and its inducing effect is mediated through the bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a recently characterized member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The ligand-activated FXR acts as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and regulates the Std gene by binding to an upstream region at base pair positions -169 to -193. This specific binding region was initially identified by bile acid responsiveness of the progressively deleted forms of the Std promoter in transfected HepG2 hepatoma and enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells. Subsequently, the precise RXR/FXR binding position was established by protein-DNA interaction using in vitro footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. Unlike all other previously characterized FXR target genes, which contain an inverted repeat (IR) of the consensus hexanucleotide half-site (A/G)G(G/T)TCA with a single nucleotide spacer (IR-1), the bile acid response element of the Std promoter does not contain any spacer between the two hexanucleotide repeats (IR-0). A promoter-reporter construct carrying three tandem copies of the IR-0 containing -169/-193 element, linked to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter, can be stimulated more than 70-fold in transfected Caco-2 cells upon CDCA treatment. Autoregulation of the STD gene by its bile acid substrate may provide an important contributing role in the enterohepatic bile acid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis.	TRUE	TRUE
11731616	Homeobox protein Gsh-1-dependent regulation of the rat GHRH gene promoter.	Although GHRH is known to play a pivotal role in the regulation of the GHRH-GH-IGF-I axis, the molecular mechanism of GHRH gene expression has not yet been examined. Here we studied the transcriptional regulation of the GHRH gene 5'promoter using an in vitro experimental model system. We especially focused on the role of homeobox transcriptional factor Gsh-1, because a dwarf phenotype and abolished GHRH expression was observed in Gsh-1 knockout mice. First, we cloned human Gsh-1, which showed 87.3% homology with mouse Gsh-1 at the nucleotide level. When the 5'-promoter region of the rat GHRH gene was introduced into the human placental cell line JEG-3, in which we found the endogenous expression of Gsh-1 as well as GHRH mRNA, substantial transcriptional activity of the promoter was recognized. Promoter activity was further enhanced by overexpression of Gsh-1 protein, whereas it was substantially reduced by elimination of Gsh-1 binding sites. EMSA confirmed the actual binding of Gsh-1 on the multiple binding sites of GHRH gene promoter. Finally, coexpression of CREB-binding protein significantly enhanced the Gsh-1-induced GHRH gene expression, suggesting the cooperative role of the coactivator protein. Because Gsh-1 is found to be expressed in the hypothalamus of the adult rat, our data provide evidence that the Gsh-1 homeobox protein plays a key role in the expression of the GHRH gene.	TRUE	TRUE
11777930	BRCA1 regulates GADD45 through its interactions with the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs.	BRCA1, a breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, has been implicated in gene regulation. Previous studies demonstrate that BRCA1 induces GADD45, a p53-regulated and stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in cellular response to DNA damage. However, the mechanism(s) by which BRCA1 regulates GADD45 remains unclear. In this report, we have shown that BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter is mediated through the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs located at the GADD45 promoter region. Site-directed mutations of both OCT-1 and CAAT motifs abrogate induction of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1. Both OCT-1 and CAAT motifs are able to confer BRCA1 inducibility in a non-related minimal promoter. Physical associations of BRCA1 protein with transcription factors Oct-1 and NF-YA, which directly bind to the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs, are established by biotin-streptavidin pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Such protein interactions are required for interaction of BRCA1 with the GADD45 promoter because either immunodepletion of Oct-1 and NF-YA proteins or mutations in the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs disrupt BRCA1 binding to the GADD45 promoter. These findings indicate that BRCA1 can up-regulate its targeted genes through protein-protein interactions and provide a novel mechanism by which BRCA1 participates in transcriptional regulation.

11832226	A calcium-responsive transcription factor, CaRF, that regulates neuronal activity-dependent expression of BDNF.	Transcription of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is regulated in a calcium- and neuron-selective manner; however, the mechanisms that underlie this selectivity are not known. We have characterized a new calcium-response element, CaRE1, that is required for activity-dependent transcription of BDNF exon III and have cloned a transcription factor, CaRF, that activates transcription from BDNF promoter III in a CaRE1-dependent manner. The transcriptional activity of CaRF is regulated in a calcium- and neuron-selective manner, suggesting that CaRF may confer selectivity upon the activity-dependent induction of BDNF exon III expression.

11893733	Activation of the murine type II transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene: up-regulation and function of the transcription factor Elf-3/Ert/Esx/Ese-1.	Previous studies demonstrated that differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells leads to transcriptional up-regulation of the mouse type II transforming growth factor-beta receptor (mTbetaR-II) gene. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating transcription of this gene, we isolated the 5'-flanking region of the mTbetaR-II gene and characterized its expression in F9-differentiated cells. Analysis of mTbetaR-II promoter/reporter gene constructs demonstrates that two conserved Ets-binding sites play an important role in the activity of the mTbetaR-II promoter. Importantly, we present evidence that mElf-3, a member of the Ets family, plays a key role in the activation of the mTbetaR-II promoter. Northern blot analysis reveals that the steady-state levels of mTbetaR-II mRNA increase in parallel with those of mElf-3 mRNA during the differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. We also demonstrate that mElf-3 contains one or more domains that influence its binding to DNA. Finally, we report that a single amino acid substitution in the transactivation domain of mElf-3 reduces its ability to transactivate and elevates its steady-state levels of expression. In conclusion, our data argue that mElf-3 plays a key role in the regulation of the mTbetaR-II gene, and Elf-3 itself is regulated at multiple levels.	TRUE	TRUE
12047722	The affinity and activity of the multiple hormone response element in the proximal promoter of the human oxytocin gene.	In vivo there appears to be a marked association between oestrogen levels and the expression of the oxytocin (OT) gene in most tissues. Transfection and DNA-protein binding experiments using high levels of either oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha or ERbeta imply a direct interaction of these transcription factors with the multiple hormone response element (HRE) at approximately -160 from the transcription start site of the OT gene in most species. In an extensive set of experiments, we show, using both transfection and protein-DNA binding, that low to moderate amounts of either oestrogen receptor, while being able to interact directly with a classic oestrogen response element (ERE) fail to interact with the human OT -160 HRE. Instead, this element, similar to its bovine counterpart, has a high affinity for the orphan receptors steroidogenic factor 1 and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor. Second, the human and bovine OT promoter can be made artificially responsive towards oestrogen in a cotransfection system over-expressing ERalpha or ERbeta, but not in cells expressing natural levels of these steroid receptors. Interestingly, nuclear extracts from both ERalpha-positive MCF7 cells and ERalpha-negative MDA-MB231 cells both contain a transcription factor which binds specifically to both the hOT-HRE element and to a classic ERE, and which has orphan receptor-like binding properties rather than those of an oestrogen receptor. Together, these and other results suggest that oestrogen action in vivo on the OT gene in all species is more likely to involve a DNA-independent mechanism than classic direct interactions with dimeric oestrogen receptors.

12087183	Functional analysis of the transcription factor ER71 and its activation of the matrix metalloproteinase-1 promoter.	The ETS transcription factor family is characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain and its members have been implicated in a plethora of biological processes, including development, cell transformation and metastasis. ER71 is a testis-specific ETS protein that is not homologous to any other protein outside its ETS domain, suggesting that it fulfills a unique physiological role. Here, we report that ER71 is a constitutively nuclear protein whose intracellular localization is dependent on a portion of the ETS domain, namely ER71 amino acids 276-315. Furthermore, the DNA binding activity is intramolecularly regulated, as the N-terminus of ER71 has a negative effect on DNA binding while the C-terminus dramatically enhances this activity. We also demonstrate that ER71 possesses an extremely potent N-terminal transactivation domain comprised of amino acids 1-157. Finally, we show that ER71 is capable of directly activating both an E74 site-driven and the matrix metalloproteinase-1 promoter. Altogether, these data represent the first functional characterization of ER71, which may perform important functions in the developing and adult testis as well as in testicular germ cell tumorigenesis.

12097386	A putative silencer element in the IL-5 gene recognized by Bcl6.	The Bcl6 gene is ubiquitously expressed in adult murine tissues and its product functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. Bcl6-deficient mice displayed eosinophilic inflammation caused by overproduction of Th2 cytokines. The regulatory mechanism of those cytokine productions by Bcl6 is controversial. When CD4(+) T cells from Bcl6-deficient and lck-Bcl6-transgenic mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 Abs, production of IL-5 among Th2 type cytokines was preferentially affected by the amount of Bcl6 in the T cells. We found a putative Bcl6-binding sequence (IL5BS) on the 3' untranslated region in the murine and human IL-5 genes, and specific binding of Bcl6 protein to the sequence was confirmed by gel retardation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The binding activity of endogenous Bcl6 was transiently diminished in Th2 but not in Th1 clones after anti-CD3 stimulation. The exogenous Bcl6 repressed expression of the reporter gene with the IL5BS in K562 cells and the repressor activity was lost by a point mutation of the IL5BS. Furthermore, the IL5BS was required for Bcl6 to repress expression of the IL-5 cDNA. Thus, the IL5BS may act as a silencer element for Bcl6 to repress expression of the IL-5 gene.	TRUE	FALSE
12242286	The myostatin gene is a downstream target gene of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MyoD.	Myostatin is a negative regulator of myogenesis, and inactivation of myostatin leads to heavy muscle growth. Here we have cloned and characterized the bovine myostatin gene promoter. Alignment of the upstream sequences shows that the myostatin promoter is highly conserved during evolution. Sequence analysis of 1.6 kb of the bovine myostatin gene upstream region revealed that it contains 10 E-box motifs (E1 to E10), arranged in three clusters, and a single MEF2 site. Deletion and mutation analysis of the myostatin gene promoter showed that out of three important E boxes (E3, E4, and E6) of the proximal cluster, E6 plays a significant role in the regulation of a reporter gene in C(2)C(12) cells. We also demonstrate by band shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that the E6 E-box motif binds to MyoD in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, cotransfection experiments indicate that among the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD preferentially up-regulates myostatin promoter activity. Since MyoD expression varies during the myoblast cell cycle, we analyzed the myostatin promoter activity in synchronized myoblasts and quiescent \"reserve\" cells. Our results suggest that myostatin promoter activity is relatively higher during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, when MyoD expression levels are maximal. However, in the reserve cells, which lack MyoD expression, a significant reduction in the myostatin promoter activity is observed. Taken together, these results suggest that the myostatin gene is a downstream target gene of MyoD. Since the myostatin gene is implicated in controlling G(1)-to-S progression of myoblasts, MyoD could be triggering myoblast withdrawal from the cell cycle by regulating myostatin gene expression.

12244173	Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 binds and activates the recombination-activating gene-2 promoter together with c-Myb and Pax-5 in immature B cells.	The recombination-activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 are expressed specifically in immature lymphoid cells undergoing the recombination of Ag receptor genes. We studied the regulation of murine RAG-2 promoter and revealed that -41/-17 RAG-2 promoter region, which was indispensable for the RAG-2 promoter activity in B cell lines, contained binding sites for lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1), c-Myb, and Pax-5. We showed that these three transcription factors bound the promoter region in vitro and in vivo. Cotransfection assays using a human embryonic kidney cell line (293T) showed that LEF-1, c-Myb, and Pax-5 cooperatively activated the RAG-2 promoter, via their synergistic DNA binding. We also showed that LEF-1, c-Myb, and Pax-5 physically interact in the cells. Finally, we demonstrated that a dominant-negative LEF-1 protein, which lacks the binding site for beta-catenin, suppressed the RAG-2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous RAG-2 expression in a pre-B cell line (18.81). These results suggest that LEF-1/beta-catenin complex regulates the RAG-2 promoter activation in concert with c-Myb and Pax-5 in immature B cells. The link between LEF-1/beta-catenin and Wnt signaling in B lineage cells will be discussed.	TRUE	TRUE
12426319	Transcription factor occupancy of the insulin gene in vivo. Evidence for direct regulation by Nkx2.2.	Consensus-binding sites for many transcription factors are relatively non-selective and found at high frequency within the genome. This raises the possibility that factors that are capable of binding to a cis-acting element in vitro and regulating transcription from a transiently transfected plasmid, which would not have higher order chromatin structure, may not occupy this site within the endogenous gene. Closed chromatin structure and competition from another DNA-binding protein with similar nucleotide specificity are two possible mechanisms by which a transcription factor may be excluded from a potential binding site in vivo. Multiple transcription factors, including Pdx-1, BETA-2, and Pax6, have been implicated in expression of the insulin gene in pancreatic beta cells. In this study, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay has been used to show that these factors do, in fact, bind to insulin control region sequences in intact beta cells. In addition, another key islet-enriched transcription factor, Nkx2.2, was found to occupy this region using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In vitro DNA-binding and transient transfection assays defined how Nkx2.2 affected insulin gene expression. Pdx-1 was also shown to bind within a region of the endogenous islet amyloid polypeptide, pax-4, and glucokinase genes that were associated with control in vitro. Because Pdx-1 does not regulate gene transcription in isolation, these sequences were examined for occupancy by the other insulin transcriptional regulators. BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 were also found to bind to amyloid polypeptide, glucokinase, and pax-4 control sequences in vivo. These studies reveal the broad application of the Pdx-1, BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 transcription factors in regulating expression of genes selectively expressed in islet beta cells.	NULL	TRUE
12446773	Early B-cell factor, E2A, and Pax-5 cooperate to activate the early B cell-specific mb-1 promoter.	Previous studies have suggested that the early-B-cell-specific mb-1(Igalpha) promoter is regulated by EBF and Pax-5. Here, we used in vivo footprinting assays to detect occupation of binding sites in endogenous mb-1 promoters at various stages of B-cell differentiation. In addition to EBF and Pax-5 binding sites, we detected occupancy of a consensus binding site for E2A proteins (E box) in pre-B cells. EBF and E box sites are crucial for promoter function in transfected pre-B cells, and EBF and E2A proteins synergistically activated the promoter in transfected HeLa cells. Other data suggest that EBF and E box sites are less important for promoter function at later stages of differentiation, whereas binding sites for Pax-5 (and its Ets ternary complex partners) are required for promoter function in all mb-1-expressing cells. Using DNA microarrays, we found that expression of endogenous mb-1 transcripts correlates most closely with EBF expression and negatively with Id1, an inhibitor of E2A protein function, further linking regulation of the mb-1 gene with EBF and E2A. Together, our studies demonstrate the complexity of factors regulating tissue-specific transcription and support the concept that EBF, E2A, and Pax-5 cooperate to activate target genes in early B-cell development.

12453415	NFATc2-mediated repression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression.	The calcineurin-regulated transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), controls many aspects of T cell function. Here, we demonstrate that the calcineurin/NFAT pathway negatively regulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). A canonical NFAT binding site was identified and found to be sensitive to calcium signals, FK506/CsA, and histone deacetylase activity and to not require AP-1. Ectopic expression of NFATc2 inhibited the basal activity of the human CDK4 promoter. Additionally, both calcineurin Aalpha(-/-) and NFATc2(-/-) mice had elevated protein levels of CDK4, confirming a negative regulatory role for the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. This pathway may thus regulate the expression of CDK4 at the transcriptional level and control how cells re-enter a resting, nonproliferative state.	TRUE	TRUE
12456679	Liver receptor homologue-1 mediates species- and cell line-specific bile acid-dependent negative feedback regulation of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter.	Intestinal reclamation of bile salts is mediated in large part by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). The bile acid responsiveness of ASBT is controversial. Bile acid feeding in mice results in decreased expression of ASBT protein and mRNA. Mouse but not rat ASBT promoter activity was repressed in Caco-2, but not IEC-6, cells by chenodeoxycholic acid. A potential liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) cis-acting element was identified in the bile acid-responsive region of the mouse but not rat promoter. The mouse, but not rat, promoter was activated by LRH-1, and this correlated with nuclear protein binding to the mouse but not rat LRH-1 element. The short heterodimer partner diminished the activity of the mouse promoter and could partially offset its activation by LRH-1. Interconversion of the potential LRH-1 cis-elements between the mouse and rat ASBT promoters was associated with an interconversion of LRH-1 and bile acid responsiveness. LRH-1 protein was found in Caco-2 cells and mouse ileum, but not IEC-6 cells or rat ileum. Bile acid response was mediated by the farnesoid X receptor, as shown by the fact that overexpression of a dominant-negative farnesoid X-receptor eliminated the bile acid mediated down-regulation of ASBT. In addition, ASBT expression in farnesoid X receptor null mice was unresponsive to bile acid feeding. In summary cell line- and species-specific negative feedback regulation of ASBT by bile acids is mediated by farnesoid X receptor via small heterodimer partner-dependent repression of LRH-1 activation of the ASBT promoter.

12468538	Heat shock factor 1 contains two functional domains that mediate transcriptional repression of the c-fos and c-fms genes.	Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), in addition to its pivotal role as a regulator of the heat shock response, functions as a versatile gene repressor. We have investigated the structural domains involved in gene repression using mutational analysis of the hsf1 gene. Our studies indicate that HSF1 contains two adjacent sequences located within the N-terminal half of the protein that mediate the repression of c-fos and c-fms. One region (NF) appears to be involved in quenching transcriptional activation factors on target promoters and binds to the basic zipper transcription factor NF-IL6 required for activation of c-fms and IL-1beta. The NF domain encompasses the leucine zipper 1 and 2 sequences as well as the linker domain between the DNA binding and leucine zipper regions. The function of this domain in gene repression is highly specific for HSF1, and the homologous region from conserved family member HSF2 does not restore repressive function in HSF2/HSF1 chimeras. In addition, HSF2 is not capable of binding to NF-IL6. The NF domain, although necessary for repression, is not sufficient, and a second region (REP) occupying a portion of the regulatory domain is required for repression. Neither domain functions independently, and both are required for repression. Furthermore, we constructed dominant inhibitors of c-fos repression by HSF1, which also blocked the repression of c-fms and IL-1beta, suggesting a shared mechanism for repression of these genes by HSF1. Our studies suggest a complex mechanism for gene repression by HSF1 involving the binding to and quenching of activating factors on target promoters. Mapping the structural domains involved in this process should permit further characterization of molecular mechanisms that mediate repression.	NULL	TRUE
12525489	The comparative role of activator protein 1 and Smad factors in the regulation of Timp-1 and MMP-1 gene expression by transforming growth factor-beta 1.	The balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), is pivotal in the remodeling of extracellular matrix. TGF-beta has profound effects on extracellular matrix homeostasis, in part via its ability to alter this balance at the level of gene expression. The intracellular signaling pathways by which TGF-beta mediates its actions include the Smad pathway, specific to the TGF-beta superfamily, but also, for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways; furthermore, cross-talk between the Smads and other signaling pathways modifies the TGF-beta response. The reciprocal effect of TGF-beta on the expression of Timp-1 and MMP-1 supports its role in matrix anabolism, yet the mechanisms by which TGF-beta induces Timp-1 and represses induced MMP-1 have remained opaque. Here, we (i) investigate the mechanism(s) by which TGF-beta1 induces expression of the Timp-1 gene and (ii) compare this with TGF-beta1 repression of phorbol ester-induced MMP-1 expression. We report that the promoter-proximal activator protein 1 (AP1) site is essential for the response of both Timp-1 and MMP-1 to TGF-beta (induction and repression, respectively). c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun are essential for the induction of Timp-1 gene expression by TGF-beta1, but these AP1 factors transactivate equally well from both Timp-1 and MMP-1 AP1 sites. Smad-containing complexes do not interact with the Timp-1 AP1 site, and overexpression of Smads does not substitute or potentiate the induction of the gene by TGF-beta1; furthermore, Timp-1 is still induced by TGF-beta1 in Smad knockout cell lines, although to varying extents. In contrast, Smads do interact with the MMP-1 AP1 site and mediate repression of induced MMP-1 gene expression by TGF-beta1.	NULL	TRUE
12559959	OTX2 regulates expression of DOPAchrome tautomerase in human retinal pigment epithelium.	Otx2 is a member of homeodomain-containing transcription factors and is essential for eye morphogenesis in mice. Here we show the expression of OTX2, the human counterpart of Otx2, in cell lines of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in Y79 retinoblastoma cells that exhibit the property of presumptive RPE. These RPE cells express DOPAchrome tautomerase (DCT) that is an enzyme involved in melanin biosynthesis. DCT may contribute to the homeostasis of RPE by detoxifying DOPA-derived metabolites. OTX2 binds to the DCT gene promoter in vivo, as judged by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, repression of endogenous OTX2 expression in Y79 cells by an anti-sense OTX2 oligonucleotide resulted in the decrease of DCT protein contents. Transient expression assays revealed that OTX2 activated the DCT gene promoter through the OTX-2-binding site in an RPE-specific manner. Therefore, OTX2 may regulate RPE-specific target genes, such as DCT, thereby maintaining the homeostasis of RPE.	TRUE	TRUE
12560487	Early growth response proteins (EGR) and nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) form heterodimers and regulate proinflammatory cytokine gene expression.	Activation of transcription factors by receptor mediated signaling is an essential step for T lymphocyte effector function. Following antigenic stimulation of T cells the two central cytokines IL-2 and TNFalpha are co-expressed and co-regulated. Two important transcription factors, i.e., early growth response (EGR) protein EGR-1 and nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) protein NFATc, regulate transcription of the human IL-2 cytokine and the same combination of EGR and NFAT proteins seems relevant for coordinated cytokine expression. Here we demonstrate that the zinc finger protein EGR-1 and two members of the NFAT protein family bind simultaneously to adjacent elements position -168 to -150 within the TNFalpha promoter. Both promoter sites are important for TNFalpha gene transcription as shown by transfection assays having the IL-2 and TNFalpha promoters linked to a luciferase reporter. The use of promoter deletion constructs with the zinc finger protein (ZIP), the NFAT binding element or a combination of both deleted show a functional cooperation of these elements and of their binding factors. These experiments demonstrate that EGR-1 as well as EGR-4 functionally cooperate with NFAT proteins and induce expression of both cytokine genes. Using tagged NFATc and NFATp in glutathione S-transferase pull down assays showed interaction and physical complex formation of each NFAT protein with recombinant, as well as native, EGR-1 and EGR-4 proteins. Thus EGR-NFAT interaction and complex formation seems essential for human cytokine expression as adjacent ZIP and NFAT elements are conserved in the IL-2 and TNFalpha gene promoters. Binding of regulatory EGR and NFAT factors to these sites and the functional interaction and formation of stable heterodimeric complexes indicate an important role of these factors for gene transcription.

12615074	The embryonic Octamer factor 3/4 displays distinct DNA binding specificity from those of other Octamer factors.	The Oct-3/4 is a transcriptional factor expressed rather specifically in inner cell mass and embryonic ectoderm during early embryogenesis in mammals. During the course of characterizing the regulatory element of embryonic transcriptional coactivator UTF1 which is one of the downstream genes of Oct-3/4, we have found that Oct-3/4, but not other Octamer factors, shows unique DNA binding specificity, being able to bind to variant Octamer sequence (5'-ACTAGCAT-3') present in UTF1 regulatory element. Here, we have determined the DNA binding property of Oct-3/4 in a systematic manner using all possible one point mutants of Octamer sequence as well as completely random sequences. These analyses led to the identification of nine distinct nucleotide sequences including the one (5'-ACTAGCAT-3') present in UTF1 regulatory element which serves rather as specific binding site for the Oct-3/4. Moreover, we show that, at least, one of the newly identified sequences, 5'-ATCAGCAT-3', exhibits a transcriptional stimulating activity equivalent to that of the variant Octamer sequence present in the UTF1 regulatory region in embryonic stem cells in a pluripotent-state specific manner.

12624109	Distinct functional interactions of human Skn-1 isoforms with Ese-1 during keratinocyte terminal differentiation.	Among the three major POU proteins expressed in human skin, Oct-1, Tst-1/Oct-6, and Skn-1/Oct-11, only the latter induced SPRR2A, a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. In this study, we have identified three Skn-1 isoforms, which encode proteins with various N termini, generated by alternative promoter usage. These isotypes showed distinct expression patterns in various skin samples, internal squamous epithelia, and cultured human keratinocytes. Skn-1a and Skn-1d1 bound the SPRR2A octamer site with comparable affinity and functioned as transcriptional activators. Skn-1d2 did not affect SPRR2A expression. Skn-1a, the largest protein, functionally cooperated with Ese-1/Elf-3, an epithelial-specific transcription factor, previously implicated in SPRR2A induction. This cooperativity, which depended on an N-terminal pointed-like domain in Skn-1a, was not found for Skn-1d1. Actually, Skn-1d1 counteracted the cooperativity between Skn-1a and Ese-1. Apparently, the human Skn-1 locus encodes multifunctional protein isotypes, subjected to biochemical cross-talk, which are likely to play a major role in the fine-tuning of keratinocyte terminal differentiation.

12626549	The cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate response element modulator suppresses IL-2 production in stimulated T cells by a chromatin-dependent mechanism.	The production of IL-2 is tightly controlled by several transcription factors that bind to the IL-2 promoter. The cAMP response element modulator (CREM) is known to form complexes with CREB and bind to the -180 site of the IL-2 promoter in anergic and in systemic lupus erythematosus T cells. In this study we show that CREM is transcriptionally induced in T cells following stimulation through CD3 and CD28, binds to the IL-2 promoter in vivo, and suppresses IL-2 production. Transfection of an antisense CREM plasmid into T cells blocked the expression and binding of CREM to the IL-2 promoter and the decrease of IL-2 production, which follows the early increase after T cell stimulation with CD3 and CD28. In addition, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, antisense CREM prevented the binding of protein 300 and cAMP response element binding protein and promoted the acetylation of histones. Antisense CREM also enhanced the accessibility of the IL-2 promoter to endonucleases and prevented the condensation of chromatin in vivo. Our data suggest that upon T cell activation, CREM gradually replaces phosphorylated CREB at the -180 site of the IL-2 promoter. CREM, in turn, binds protein 300 and cAMP response element binding protein, but CREM is unable to activate its histone acetyltransferase activity, which results in condensation of chromatin and down-regulation of IL-2 production.

12637547	Ets-2 and components of mammalian SWI/SNF form a repressor complex that negatively regulates the BRCA1 promoter.	Ets-2 is a transcriptional activator that can be modulated by ras-dependent phosphorylation. Evidence is presented indicating that ets-2 can also act as a transcriptional repressor. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, exogenous ets-2 repressed the activity of a BRCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter dependent on a conserved ets-2-binding site in this promoter. Conditional overproduction of ets-2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in repression of endogenous BRCA1 mRNA expression. To address the mechanism by which ets-2 could act as a repressor, a biochemical approach was used to identify proteins that interacted with the ets-2 pointed domain. From this analysis, components of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex were found to interact with ets-2. Brg-1, the ATP-hydrolyzing component of the SWI/SNF complex, along with the BAF57/p50 and Ini1 subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated from cells with ets-2. The pointed domain of ets-2 directly interacted in vitro with the C-terminal region of Brg-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The combination of Brg-1 and ets-2 could repress the BRCA1 promoter reporter in transfection assays. These results support a role for ets-2 as a repressor and indicate that components of the mammalian SNF/SWI complex are required as co-repressors.	NULL	TRUE
12690040	Identification of a nuclear orphan receptor (Ear2) as a negative regulator of renin gene transcription.	A potent transcriptional enhancer was previously identified upstream of the mouse renin gene. Within the enhancer is a TGACCT direct-repeat motif, required for enhancer activity, that is the consensus sequence recognized by members of the thyroid hormone subfamily of steroid hormone receptors. We previously reported that RAR/RXR bind to this sequence and mediate the induction of renin promoter activity by retinoids. However, gel mobility shift assays clearly show that other as yet unidentified factors also bind to this motif. In order to identify some of these TGACCT binding factors, we screened a yeast one-hybrid cDNA library derived from mouse As4.1 cells. One of these encoded the orphan nuclear receptor Ear2. Recombinant Ear2 was purified from Escherichia coli and an antipeptide antisera was generated. EMSA showed that purified recombinant Ear2 specifically binds the TGACCT direct-repeat motif. Transfection assays showed that Ear2 potently decreases both baseline and retinoid-induced mouse renin promoter activity in a dose-dependent, enhancer-dependent, and sequence-specific manner. Mutations in Ear2, which abolish its binding to the TGACCT motif, also abolish transcriptional repression. Ear2 was identified as a nuclear protein in As4.1 cells, is one of the proteins binding to the TGACCT repeat motif, and its overexpression can repress transcription of the endogenous renin gene in As4.1 cells. These data suggest that Ear2 is a negative modulator of renin gene transcription in As4.1 cells, and that the renin enhancer may actually encode a complex positive and negative regulator of transcription.

12729460	Extracellular ATP stimulates the early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway in the human osteoblastic HOBIT cell line.	Extracellular nucleotides exert an important role in controlling cell physiology by activating intracellular signalling cascades. Osteoblast HOBIT cells express P2Y(1) and P2Y(2) G-protein-coupled receptors, and respond to extracellular ATP by increasing cytosolic calcium concentrations. Early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) is a C(2)H(2)-zinc-finger-containing transcriptional regulator responsible for the activation of several genes involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is thought to have a central role in osteoblast biology. We show that ATP treatment of HOBIT cells increases Egr-1 protein levels and binding activity via a mechanism involving a Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase C isoform. Moreover, hypotonic stress and increased medium turbulence, by inducing ATP release, result in a similar effect on Egr-1. Increased levels of Egr-1 protein expression and activity are achieved at very early times after stimulation (5 min), possibly accounting for a rapid way for changing the osteoblast gene-expression profile. A target gene for Egr-1 that is fundamental in osteoblast physiology, COL1A2, is up-regulated by ATP stimulation of HOBIT cells in a timescale that is compatible with that of Egr-1 activation.

12750007	Ets transcription factors ER81 and Elk1 regulate the transcription of the human presenilin 1 gene promoter.	We have previously defined a crucial DNA element controlling 90% of the expression of the presenilin 1 gene at (-35 to +6). This region contains an Ets transcription factor binding motif, and a 2-base pair alteration within the core sequence (GGAA to TTAA) of the Ets consensus also reduced transcription by over 90%. We have shown that Ets1/2 transcription factors bind specifically to the -10 Ets element and activate PS1 transcription. The identification of other transcription factors recognizing specifically this promoter area should provide insights into the regulation of PS1. We have used the -10 Ets element as a bait in yeast one hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library. This assay selected three factors from the Ets family: Ets2, ER81 and Elk1. We show that in vitro translated ER81 indeed binds specifically to the -10 region of the PS1 promoter and that ER81 activates by two- to threefold the basal transcription of a presenilin-1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter synthetic gene (-119, +178)PS1CAT in transient infection assays in neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH). GABPalpha, a member of the Ets family closely related to Ets2 and also containing a pointed domain, only increased PS1 transcription by about twofold. Cotransfection of GABPbeta together with GABPalpha did not increase PS1 transcription. However, GABPbeta alone activated PS1 transcription by two- to threefold. In contrast, the more distantly related Ets factor Elk1 repressed PS1 transcription very effectively.	TRUE	TRUE
12756174	Retinal pigmented epithelium determination requires the redundant activities of Pax2 and Pax6.	The transcription factors Pax2 and Pax6 are co-expressed in the entire optic vesicle (OV) prior and concomitant with the establishment of distinct neuroretinal, retinal, pigmented-epithelial and optic-stalk progenitor domains, suggesting redundant functions during retinal determination. Pax2; Pax6 compound mutants display a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of the melanocyte determinant Mitf, accompanied by transdifferentiation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) into neuroretina (NR) in Pax2(-/-); Pax6(+/-) embryos, which strongly resembles the phenotype of Mitf-null mutants. In Pax2(-/-); Pax6(-/-) OVs Mitf fails to be expressed and NR markers occupy the area that usually represents the Mitf(+) RPE domain. Furthermore, both, Pax2 and Pax6 bind to and activate a MITF RPE-promoter element in vitro, whereas prolonged expression of Pax6 in the Pax2-positive optic stalk leads to ectopic Mitf expression and RPE differentiation in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that the redundant activities of Pax2 and Pax6 direct the determination of RPE, potentially by directly controlling the expression of RPE determinants.	NULL	FALSE
